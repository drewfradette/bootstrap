# Bootstrap

## Overview

`dotfiles` on steroids. This will bootstrap a Fedora system using Ansible.

## Features

This is intended to get my Linux environment setup as quickly as possible. It will
do the following:

  - Install common packages (`tmux`,`htop`, et al).
  - Install and config `i3`, `vim`, `bash` and `terminator`
  - Install some nice fonts.
  - Provide `bin` files.
  - Setup `git` (`gitconfig`)
  - Install custom repositories.

## To Do
Still a few things to do here:

  - Clean up `vimrc`
  - Add `i3` scripts for dual monitor
  - Make compatible with Ubuntu
  - Add support for themes (maybe?)
